ABOUT---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a website for the Brown University Club Polo team. It was built from
Fall 2017 to Spring 2018 by Michael Kearney '20 and is currently maintained by
him. The website was designed jointly by Bryn Sullivan '20 and Michael.


INFORMATION FOR FUTURE WEBMASTERS-----------------------------------------------
We use this public GitHub repository to maintain version control amongst the
website's administrators. Contact Michael Kearney to be added as a contributor
to this repository. Hosting is through Google Domains.

As of March 2018, the focus is on finishing building the desktop version of the
website. Subsequent effort will be focused on creating mobile and tablet
versions. It is important that the information on this website be kept up to
date. Annually changing information, such as officers and schedule, will be
tagged with an as of yet undetermined comment system to ensure old information
is removed and the current information is added.

The website is designed as a single scrolling page with a vertical menu bar on
the left side of the page. On mobile, the menu will be a drop-down menu at the
top of the screen. The design of the website makes significant use of flexboxes.
A guide to the use of flexboxes can be found below.
